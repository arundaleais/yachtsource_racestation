Yes it will but I hope you know more about Windows 8 than I do.

Eg The Laptop I got to try Windows 8.1 (x64)  after 10 mins switched on suddenly decides it's going to reboot to install a Windows update !!
Obviously things like this need stopping. I'm finding Windows 8 VERY frustrating - having to continually use Help on my XP pc to find out how to do simple tasks.

I set up https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/sw/ntp.htm to be used as a time server as its much better than using Microsoft and is more accurate.
It sync's each time the PC is switched on, what I don't want it doing is changing the time (even by a second) half way through a race.

You should be able to access the controller board with http://eth008/ as long as the pc is on the 192.168.1 subnet. This will enable you to set up a fixed IP address. Please leave The default login as (case sensitive):
 Username: admin
 Password: password

DNS1	8.8.8.8	(Google)
DNS2	194.74.65.68 (BT)

Router Gateway 192.168.1.254
Race Station reserved IP addresses 192.168.1.243 to 253

type %temp%\racingsignalslog.log

This opens a YouTube tutorial (20 mins) on basic touch screen actions

I have also attached the test program set-up
