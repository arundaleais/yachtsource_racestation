Using CAPICOM on Windows x64
8 Replies	

So CAPICOM was one of the project I was responsible for while at Microsoft,
 its been discontinued but I always find it useful
  it is kind of a Swiss Army knife for CryptoAPI certificate stores
 when paired with its VBS samples.

One of its problems is we never shipped with x64 bit version,
 you can do similar things with PowerShell and the .NET classes
 (this is why it was discontinued) but I still find this the quickest
 way to do stuff sometimes so I keep it in my toolbelt.

Here is what you need to know to make it work:

    Windows can run 32bit things in 64bit environments.
    You cannot have a 64bit thing call a 32bit thing.
    Windows ships a 32bit cmd prompt.
    Windows ships a 32bit regsrv32.


To use CAPICOM you need to:

    Download CAPICOM  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25281
    Install CAPICOM
    Register CAPICOM

    Open an administrative command prompt
    cd to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft CAPICOM 2.1.0.2 SDK\Lib\X86
    copy CAPICOM.DLL %windir%\syswow64
    %windir%\syswow64\regsvr32.exe %windir%\syswow64\capicom.dll
    exit the command prompt

This worked

run the CMD.exe as Administrator. 

 Steps:
 (c:)> Windows> Syswow32> Scroll down to CMD.exe, right click and 'Run as Administrator'


 Then you can just regsvr32 xxxxx.dll
